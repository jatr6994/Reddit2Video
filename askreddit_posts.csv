"Hi Reddit,
I (and probably many others too) don't have a clue what to do with my life, so how about a mini job fair. Just comment what your job is and why you chose it so that others can ask questions about it and perhaps see if it is anything for them.

EDIT: Woooow guys this went fast. Its nice to see that so many people are so passionate about their jobs.

EDIT 2: Damn, we just hit number 1 on the front page. I love you guys

EDIT 3: /u/Katie_in_sunglasses Told me That it would be a good idea to have a search option for big posts like this to find certain jobs. Since reddit doesnt have this you can probably load all comments and do (Ctrl + f) and then search for the jobs you are interested in.
